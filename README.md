Project Description
The Password Generator is a small React-based tool that allows you to generate random passwords. It offers customization options such as setting the password length and selecting character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). You can easily copy the generated password to the clipboard with a click of a button.

This project is a fun and useful way to practice React, hooks, and modern JavaScript features such as the Clipboard API and handling of form inputs.

Features
Select the length of the password.

Choose from four different types of characters to include: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Display password strength (Weak, Medium, Strong, Very Strong).

Copy the generated password to clipboard with a simple button click.

Show a success message after copying the password.

Technologies Used
React – The main framework for building the user interface.

JavaScript – For the logic of generating random passwords and handling the clipboard.

CSS (Tailwind) – For styling and responsive design.

Lucide React Icons – For using the Copy icon to trigger the copy-to-clipboard action.
